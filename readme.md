Problemn Statement: 

Many people enjoy hiking.  Getting in touch with nature by walking through 
tree covered landscape listening to the sounds that aren’t often heard in 
the rat race of the city.  However, what many parents don’t enjoy is loading 
their kids into the car, driving an hour when the kids don’t want to go in 
the first place, and finding out that the trail they’ve been looking forward 
to isn’t what they were hoping for.  Maybe it doesn’t have the natural effects 
they had pictured in their mind, like a rushing river, a beautiful lake, or 
large trees filled with chirping birds lining the trail.  There are numerous 
websites that give trail recommendations, but it seems like you have to go 
to multiple websites to get the different pieces of information used to decide 
if a trail is worth hiking.   

I’d like to create a website that hopefully gives the hiking enthusiast a one 
stop shop option where they can find most of the information needed to choose 
next hiking adventure.  This would include information such as the trail 
length and difficulty.  An explanation of what types of natural beauty can 
be seen from the trail.  Whether the trail is family friendly or will have 
features that would peak the interest of young and older kids alike.  
Recommendations and reviews from other hikers and families.  Users will also 
able to save their favorite trails and give them a rating.
